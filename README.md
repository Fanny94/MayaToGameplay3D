# MayaToGameplay3D
Real-time custom viewer for Maya

This is a project developed by two students (https://github.com/Fanny94, https://github.com/Raxo94). 

The project is a real-time communication mechanism between Maya and a rendering engine using message passing through
shared memory. Conceptually, All changes of a 3D model in Maya (ex. transformation) will be seen and updated almost immediately in the engine in real-time.

the project is divided in two executable programs; ImportNodesFromMaya and MayaImporter.
